## 🚀 Mission

**Pleading Sanity** is a movement born from struggle, built to turn pain into power.  
This site is the **Infinity Build v1** — the clean, deploy-ready hub for our community, brand, and vision.  

We are creating a space where:
- 🌍 Survivors share their stories (Human Hub)  
- 🤖 AI contributes inspiration and experiments (AI Hub with Arron)  
- ✨ Hidden portals unlock meditation, silence challenges, and inner chambers  
- 🛒 Merch + supporters become part of the cosmic wall  
- 🎙️ Podcasts, Journals, Games, and Kids Awakening expand the movement

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Static HTML/CSS/JS** → fast, simple, and extendable  
- **Dynamic Feeds** → YouTube + AI-ready via `config.js`  
- **Firebase-ready** → for auth, posts, and real-time updates (future patches)  
- **PWA (Progressive Web App)** → installable on desktop/mobile  
- **Netlify** → auto-deploy with `_redirects` + `netlify.toml`  
- **Cosmic Assets** → SVG logos, starfield animations, healing audio (432 Hz)
